# 3D Deathchase Demo

testing speed of raycaster on Arduboy.

After trying this demo, I'd
recommend only re-programming when the game is either at 
the title screen, or paused ('A' key) to be sure it will work.

TODO: add enemy bikes, rocket launcher, 'put put' engine sound.
MAYBE DO: day/night mode (invert graphics), transitions.
